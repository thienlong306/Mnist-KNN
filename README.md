# Mnist KNN

We’ll be using the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is one of the most well studied datasets in the computer vision and machine learning literature. In many cases, it’s a benchmark and a standard to which machine learning algorithms are ranked.
